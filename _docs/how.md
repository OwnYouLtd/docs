title: How
subtitle: OwnYou makes it easy for individuals to convert their raw data into intelligent profiles. Publishers get access to much higher quality reader meta data, increasing the value of their inventory, and advertisers reach the most relevant audience, reducing wasted advertising spend, improving ROI. Helping individuals monetize their personal data, psuedonimously, converts the experience from predatory to transactional.

{% include alert.html style="danger" text="We discuss stakeholder requirements, in much more detail, in dedicated sections. Here, we will walk you through three stakeholder narratives. OwnYou from a consumer, advertiser and publisher perspective." %}

Note that we discuss the <a href="/docs/docs/intelligence_stack/">Intelligence Stack</a> separately.

### The Consumer

Jane has downloaded the OwnYou app and watched a 30-second animation that made it clear that her data is secure and only she has access to anything she uploads to her OwnYou storage. Setting up the app was simple and rewarded her with tokens for every new source she connected, like her email, bank account, and photos. After a few seconds, the app suggested what Jane likes and what she's most interested in. She was then given the option to synchronize her digital driver's license, passport or other verified credentials. The app presents Jane with several tabs, including easy-to-access media, price comparisons for services she already uses, and a game tab with two games, "Do You Know You" and an Easter egg game. The final tab allowed her to upload her digital assets, tokens, and NFTs, and check how many tokens she had earned and convert them to fiat money.

The media tab automatically exchanges Jane's psuedonymous media profile for access to content otherwise only accessible with a subscription. She sees fewer, more relevant, ads and is therefore more likely to engage. Jane felt comfortable with the personalized content and advertising, knowing she was pseudonymous to both the media provider and the advertisers. She could see what information she was sharing and limit it, but she understands that sharing more descriptive information means she has access to more free content. The apps makes it clear this is a transactional relationship, where she remains in control. She can also see an icon that leads her to a simple graphic showing her what data he has shared and with whom, as well as her attribution exhaust. Since sharing attribution data gets her the most money, she was happy to share that information.

While waiting for her train, Jane played the Easter egg game and discovered all the discounts offered by shops around her office. At lunchtime, she went to one of her favorite brands to see what was on offer. As she walked into the shop, her phone pinged with an offer on gloves. It was cold outside, and her gloves were looking pretty tatty. She clicked on the items and automatically purchased the gloves with fiat or tokens, with the discount. She also saw that her favorite food outlet was offering a lunch deal to the first twenty customers today, so she swung by to pick up lunch. OwnYou knows what deals and discounts matter the most to her, and she didn't have to share her personal information or location with anyone. Nice.

### The Publisher

Big Media Ltd, popularly known as Big, have celebrated the recent pivot to first-party data. The impending cookiepocalipse, where all third-party cookies are deprecated, has advertisers reaching for the next best option, first-party data. And Big has the biggest first-party database in the world. At first, and because the data isn't particularly high resolution, advertisers had to spend more to reach the same audiences as before, which meant more money for Big. However lower returns for advertisers soon had them looking for alternatives.
Big also recognizes that the more information they provide to advertisers, the more advertisers are willing to pay for their inventory. This is clearly the case with contextual data, when combined with user demographics.

At the same time, the winds might be changing with respect to first-party data and consumer consent. It used to be possible to get readers to just waive all their rights on registration. The regulatory climate has become steadily more restrictive and it might be the case that readers will have to provide more explicit consent before first-party data can be shared. Worst still, publishers may have to provide users with more control over how their data is retained, shared and deleted, when requested. More first-party data used to be better than less but an increasingly complex regulatory landscape complicates things.

Big has always boasted about it's relatively large subscriber base but what they spend less time communicating is how small that number is in proportion to the potential reader base. They have been using increasingly sophisticated options that introduce new subscribers by offering limited access but the fact remains that any paywall is going to limit the number of eye-balls.

OwnYou provides them with the best of both worlds. With relatively little additional code, they have added an OwnYou login button on their homepage. Any user logging in with that option shares detailed information far beyond what they have been able to capture on their own. Better yet, they can now pass that information through to advertisers using their existing header bidder setup. The more granular, and authentic, information substantially increases the value of their inventory. And because the user is psuedonymous, they don't have the hassle of having to manage user data. Big focuses on attracting the best audience, with high quality content, and OwnYou helps them monetize their inventory with next to no additional technology cost. Happy days for the team at Big.

### The Advertiser

Widget Inc sells all sorts of widgets. Big widgets for Mr Large in Knightsbridge, and little widgets to Mrs Miggins in Southend on Sea. It isn't always easy for Widget Inc to find more customers like Mr Large and Mrs Miggins. It is important to direct the campaign for big widgets to customers like Mr Large, and the campaign for little widgets to customers like Mrs Miggins. Mrs Miggins wouldn't appreciate being shown an ad for big widgets, not all all. She wouldn't know which way round to hold it. In the past, Widget Inc relied on data management companies to find specific audiences for targeted campaigns, but without third-party cookies, they now have to rely on less effective first-party cookies. Moreover, the deprecation of third-party cookies and more restrictive privacy policies by Apple have made attribution reporting increasingly complex and unreliable.

OwnYou introduces an entirely new approach. The information individuals share is not only guaranteed to be authentic (no more bots!) but the quality of information is unmatched; it is more granular and more relevant. Widget Inc can request an attribution relationship, which they pay the individual for directly, and that helps them track both how many times they are serving a campaign to the same individual across different media and different platforms. It also allows them to connect to an individual directly with customized campaigns, which helps with conversions. This entirely new approach, that allows them to open a transactional relationship with individuals, paying for the right to advertise to them, helps them navigate an increasingly complex privacy landscape. Above all, because audience targeting is so much more precise, because attribution is deterministic and a function of a direct relationship with the individual, the return on advertising spend is orders or magnitude higher.

Finally, thanks to engaging OwnYou Ltd, they now have a real time feel for changing consumer trends. OwnYou Ltd provides insight on what products and services will get the best traction, how to optimize campaigns, and how to leverage OwnYou's unique, time and location based, easter-egg marketing platform.

Overall, by engaging with OwnYou Ltd, Widget Inc gains a competitive advantage in navigating an increasingly complex privacy landscape and delivering more relevant and effective campaigns to their target audience.
