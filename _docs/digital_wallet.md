{% include image.html img="digital_wallet.jpg" lightbox="true" alt="Digital Wallet" caption="The OwnYou Digital wallet manages keys, crypto and cash transactions, as well as access control for all personal data." %}

Key operations are fundamental to much of OwnYou’s functionality. Every sign-on, personal data share, attribution and completion subscriptions, and all transactions are signed, and in some cases, encrypted with the relevant entity’s keys.

Individuals use a new set of keys with every sign-on. The user’s wallet creates a new DID key pair for every publisher interaction, creating a new pseudonymous identity, helping to limit correlation risk.

Only the user keeps track of their DIDs and blockchain addresses in their master digital wallet. A wallet agent rolls up all payments for the individual to monitor and spend.

OwnYou does not seek to innovate on Digital Wallet design, nor on managing key operations, including sign/verify, encrypt/decrypt and commit/reveal.
