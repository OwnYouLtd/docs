title: How to use this documentation
subtitle: This website is a call to arms. It explains why OwnYou has roots in real user problems, and how we expect to solve them. We suggest how technology can be pulled together into a decentralized platform. We explain how a token economy provides healthy incentives that contribute to a more equitable outcome. We suggest how governance might transition control from OwnYou Ltd towards an OwnYou DAO. OwnYou Ltd will kick start development but we hope to inspire participation, and contributions to the code. We will regularly link to our Github repository where issues can be discussed and where PRs result in contributions to the code base.

In the Getting Started section, we provide a high level overview of our mission, how it impacts key stakeholders and the important building blocks.

In the following section, Experiences and Workflows, we walk you through a high level architecture before expanding on the individual user, advertiser and publisher value propositions. While the Blogs provide background material on the problems we want to solve, and what we think matters most to each stakeholder, the main documentation discusses the solution.

We also introduce the Dynamic Price Comparison model, and Easter Egg marketing.

The Building Blocks section introduces the main technology components and the section on the Business Model and Economy will help you understand how money flows and to whom it flows.

Finally, the Team section introduces current, and prospective, team members.
