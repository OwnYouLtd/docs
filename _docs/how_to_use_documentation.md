title: How to use this documentation
subtitle: This website is a call to arms. It explains why OwnYou has roots in real user problems, and how we expect to solve them. We suggest how technology can be pulled together into a decentralized platform. We explain how a token economy provides healthy incentives that contribute to a more equitable outcome. We suggest how governance might transition control from OwnYou Ltd towards an OwnYou DAO. OwnYou Ltd will kick start development but we hope to inspire participation, and contributions to the code. We will regularly link to our Github repository where issues can be discussed and where PRs result in contributions to the code base.

In the Getting Started section, we provide a high level overview of our mission, platform deliverables and building blocks. In the following sections we establish what problems need fixing, we explore what stakeholders want before suggesting solutions. Our suggested architecture leverages existing protocols and primitives while identifying boundaries and limitations that require further research and development. Some of the material will reference background material available in our blogs, including a brief history of digital advertising where we introduce the existing advertising technology stack, before introducing cookies, their impact on privacy, subsequent deprecation, and related fallout. The following sections will be broken down in to key stakeholder perspective. We discuss why the current status quo is problematic for people, publishers, and advertisers. Finally, we conclude with our solution, outlining both architecture and product. Please refer to the appendix at the end of the document for important terminology.
