### Six individual user value propositions

### Take control of your personal data – Own You

We help people make money from their personal data with a simple to use, fun and engaging user experience.

- The OwnYou user application will be easy to use.
- It will be fun.
- It will generate income for the user.

While early adopters may struggle through a poorly designed user interface (as a hundred million crypto users will attest to), an engaging user experience (UX) is a day one requirement for any application that needs users to commit to an unfamiliar decentralized architecture. For OwnYou to succeed, we need users to upload their personal data, and we need them to trust the application. Complete user commitment is important because the more personal data they upload, the richer the intelligence inferred.

A dramatic narrative around big tech stealing your personal data will tire quickly, and we do not believe a negative message sustains momentum to a hundred million users. Instead, a positive message around ownership, control and reward is more likely to get sustainable traction. Our first UX will include the following features:

- An OwnYou avatar where the more data the user uploads, the more items available for personalizing the avatar.
- Additional OwnYou tokens for the first 10,000 users to reach specific upload thresholds.
- “Know yourself” trivia.
- “Do you think you know me” games that can be shared with other users.
- Ranking system to show the user’s sharing percentile.
- Rankings and percentiles on monetization.

All data will be sourced from OwnYou business services.

As OwnYou gathers momentum, gamification will need to evolve from avatars and rankings to more sophisticated games tailored to personality and demographics, all engineered to encourage users to harvest their own personal data.

### Know yourself adds a little intrigue to the user experience

Your personal data reveals a lot about who you are. The more you add, the more you are likely to learn. Gamifying the “getting to know yourself” process has enormous potential. Users can opt to share the data with privacy preserving comparison metrics; “did you know you are 75% more likely to buy a holiday this week than at any other time in the year”. Tying metrics into offers, so users can see why they are being offered certain ads and promotions, inverts the notion of surveillance advertising; your data, which only you can see, is driving this type of marketing. You can see all these offers because of your likely willingness to make a particular purchase, now.

### Login with OwnYou

<span style="color: #e81313">Login with Own-You</span> with makes it painless to access publisher websites, with a couple of clicks, and without the need to share any personal informatio, no sharing email address, no remember passwords, no having to click on various personal data disclaimers. The OwnYou architecture is designed around unique, one-time, interactions with publishers. The individual user’s relationship with the publisher is transactional, discrete, and ephemeral. High quality, reliable and detailed privacy preserving personal data is exchanged for one-time access using one-time identifiers. This helps simplify the login process. The publisher need only verify the user’s authenticity, and confirm audience suitability, prior to granting access. Suitability can translate into different levels of access; the Financial Times might choose to grant different access rights to Mrs Miggins the pie maker and Mr Bateman the investment banker, reflecting target audience profile valuations and advertiser fit.
Whether we implement OwnYou sign-on with SIWE (Sign-on With Ethereum) or another related innovation, the barriers to implementation are increasingly low.

### “Easter eggs” are both entertaining and valuable

They grant users access to local discounts and allow marketers to gather important information on local demand trends. There are plenty of coupon/loyalty programs available to customers is all geographies. OwnYou innovates with privacy preserving features. Brands have an opportunity to connect with individual pseudonymously, without having to collect personal data but relying instead on high quality demographic and target audience profiles. Individuals have an opportunity to benefit from discounts and coupons without laborious sign-up or subscription requirements.

Easter eggs act like coupons that only unlock when a user is in a specific location (a region, a town or even a street) and their pseudonymous personal data matches certain criteria. For instance, a chain of supermarkets might launch a coupon for a new range of own-branded goods. Coupons only materialize in user wallets when the location, the target audience profile and target demographics match the advertisers’ requirements.
Revealing location is sensitive information for most individuals. No one wants to be tracked. With OwnYou, coupons are deposited in the user’s wallet (after opt-in) and only unlock when GPS co-ordinates match set criteria. The advertiser is not notified unless the individual activates the offer, and then only a pseudonymous profile is shared.

Easter eggs have gamification potential. Consider a version of Pokémon GO but instead of monsters, the consumer collects brand generate characters, in a specific location, by scanning real world QR codes for prizes. All while never needing to share their personally identifiable information.

### Dynamic price comparison helps individuals optimise their service provider relationships

Client-side algorithms trawl user data for service agreements, dynamically scanning for utility bills, insurance renewal dates, and even OTT media subscriptions. Users can modify the results and add details manually.

OwnYou will tie up with a price comparison site. Information around service agreements and renewal dates will be shared with the price comparison site pseudonymously. Any more optimal service will be introduced in the user’s app. Should the user wish to continue, one-click authorises and shares the required personal information with the price comparison partner to complete the process.

OwnYou innovates by using personal data to dynamically search for better deals, without users having to share any personally identifiable information.
