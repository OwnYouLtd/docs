OwnYou Ltd serves two purposes - firstly, and most important, OwnYou Ltd has been incorporated to develop enough infrastructure for OwnYou to reach escape velocity. Once OwnYou's architecture reached a critical mass of transactions, supported by a diverse community of stakeholders, OwnYou Ltd will transition control or both development, and governance, to the OwnYou DAU.

Second, OwnYou Ltd provide businesses and advertisers insight into community statistics, purchasing trends and other data that might help with marketing and product development. OwnYou Ltd will act as an oracle, measuring population statistics and helping to identify miscreant behaviour. OwnYou Ltd will have exclusive rights to ask users to contribute to a data union for data mining purposes.

OwnYou Ltd will be owned by the community, through the foundation’s stake, by the founders, OwnYou Ltd’s employees and early investors. OwnYou Ltd will have the exclusive rights to provide, for an initial period, consultancy and development services to publishers and advertisers looking to maximize the value of the OwnYou community. After that period, the OwnYou DAU will either renew the contract or issue a license to one or more other service providers. The DAU will have an option to buy the founder stake.

Brand Lift Measurement requires a bird’s eye view on the population. OwnYou Ltd will be uniquely positioned to provide custom analytics and insight. This may include carrying out surveys and more detailed research.

OwnYou Ltd, and its Business Services division, will not be able to access any user’s personal data without express permission. There will be no privileged access of any kind, without express user permission, nor will any services be withheld. OwnYou Ltd will serve to provide business intelligence services and no part of the user, publisher or advertiser experience should be impacted by their operations.

While OwnYou will be partly owned by the community, likely through the OwnYou DAO, and eventually the OwnYou DAU, it will be incorporated as a separate legal entity under the control of the founders via a dual class share structure.
