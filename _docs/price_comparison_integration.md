<span style="color: #e81313">Dynamic price comparison helps individuals optimise their service provider relationships</span>.

Client-side algorithms, provided by the Intelligence Stack, trawl user data for service agreements, dynamically scanning for utility bills, insurance renewal dates, and even OTT media subscriptions. Users can modify the results and add details manually. As a reminder, the Intelligence Stack can not directly access the individual's personal data.

OwnYou will tie up with a price comparison site. Information around service agreements and renewal dates will be shared with the price comparison site pseudonymously, with the user's demographic profile. Any more optimal service will be introduced in the userâ€™s app. Should the user wish to continue, one-click authorises and shares the required personal information with the price comparison partner to complete the process.
