subtitle: OwnYou consists of the Intelligence Stack where data is stored and processed, verified credentials, where identity is authenticated and shared, and business process workflows for advertising and other applications. Underpinning all processes lies decentralized computing and blockchain enabled transactions.

Consider this a general overview. We will dig into each layer, and each component, in subsequent sections.

### OwnYou's architecture

OwnYou's architecture consists of the [Intelligence Stack](/docs/intelligence_stack/), including [personal data capture](/docs/personal_data_capture) and [storage](/docs/personal_data_storage), a [verified credential protocol](/docs/verified_credential_workflow) and a [digital wallet](/docs/digital_wallet) connecting to different business entity workflows.

### OwnYou's principle components

It also helps to think about OwnYou as a number of layers.

- At the bottom, layer 1, lies the engine room - where data is stored, and where computing resources are deployed to convert raw data into valuable information, and where transactions are recorded on-chain.
- Layer 2 facilitates pseudonymous peer to peer communication, leveraging decentralized identifiers.
- Layer 3 is the protocol layer, which handles credential issuance and verification, payment, messaging and premissioning protocols for the Intelligence Stack.
- Layer 4 is the application layer, facilitating advertising workflows, dynamic price comparison and other applications.
