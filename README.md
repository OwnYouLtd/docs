## This repo is used to maintain OwnYou's web documentation and solicit discussion and contributions to the OwnYou architecture.

### Vision

We are building core architecture for individuals to harvest their own personal data, make it available to third party machine learning entities to extract and monetize intelligent personal profiles, in a privacy preserving manner.

The OwnYou documentation will help you better understand our vision and how the architecture works.

We want this to remain an open source project. Your contribution will bring OwnYou to life.

Ultimately, OwnYou will form the base personal data layer for intelligent personal AI. But before we get to that, we need to figure out:

- how to efficiently harvest an individual's personal data in secure decentralized storage,
- how to make that data available to third party machine learning algorithms, and
- how to help individuals share, and monetize, their intelligent profiles with advertisers, and other commercial opportunities, in a privacy preserving manner.

### Contributions

There are a couple of ways you can discuss new ideas and contributions to the architecture. You can submit a new issue on this discord repo or you can drop into the relevant Discord channel:

- [Intelligence Stack](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321483884294315), a community of independent machine learning experts, extracting intelligence from private personal data.
- [Decentralized Storage](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321420273459330), that allows individuals to store their raw personal data in a secure manner and run third party machine learning algorithms in a privacy preserving manner.
- [Digital Advertising](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613236741574696) using OwnYou's privacy preserving, equitable, personal data
- [Other applications](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613645673648138) that leverage intelligent privacy preserving personal data
- [Incentivization](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078614046808481843) architecture that compensates the intelligence stack, compute and storage suppliers, and individuals for sharing their personal, albeit pseudonymous, data.
