title: Why is it decentralized?

Personal data and third-party control do not mix well. Until recently, there has been no other option. While most of the world obsesses over tokens and prices, we think crypto is more about decentralization and the opportunity to build more equitable, more balanced, and therefore more robust systems. We see many emerging alternatives to the existing personal data stack, largely around advertising, that offer more user protection, and in some cases more equitable compensation, but they remain centralized. The evidence suggests the more successful a centrally managed solution, the more corrupted and dysfunctional it becomes. The opposite is true for a decentralized system - the more successful it becomes, the more value it distributes to the entire community, the stronger the ties, the more value created, and the more opportunity for a virtuous cycle.

While components of Ownyou will birthed from within Ownyou Ltd, everything we build will be purposed for decentralized governance. It is a journey, and one we very much hope you will be part of.
