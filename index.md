  title: Our Personal Data Revolution
  subtitle: Everyone wants your personal data. You want access to the best content, and the goods and services that improve your life. We make it easy for you to generate intelligence from your own personal data. You can use that intelligence to access media, get the juiciest discounts on the things you want, when you most want them, and make money. OwnYou is not another middle man, but instead an open source, decentralized, community of stakeholders. Welcome to the Decentralized Web. Welcome to OwnYou!

<!--
Publishers, advertisers, financial companies, and many other businesses, of all shapes and sizes, want to get to know you. They all want your personal data. Sometimes that works for you because you want access to the best content, and the goods and services that improve your life. But big tech generates over a trillion dollars a year matching your data to companies wanting a relationship with you. That doesn't make much sense to us. Instead, we want to make it easy for you to generate intelligence from your own personal data. You can use that intelligence to access media, connect to the best deals from all manner of service providers, and get the juiciest discounts on the things you want, when you most want them. We want you to get your share of that trillion dollars a year. Most important, we do not want to replace big tech with another middle man but instead we want to foster an open source development platform  and an equitable, regenerative, community. The OwnYou documentation can help you better understand our mission and goals, and how we think the technology will come together. We want this to remain an open source project. Your contribution will bring OwnYou to life. -->
