Programmatic advertising addresses the following problem set; how do publishers without the ability to sell inventory directly to brands, or with residual inventory, maximize the value of their inventory? Conversely, how do advertisers without access to, or the budget for, direct purchases of high-quality inventory, maximize the return on their advertising budgets?

The following utility curve suggests an advertiser should be indifferent between spending their budget on a high volume of easy to purchase, lower quality, ads and a purchase of a much lower volume of more expensive, and difficult to purchase, higher quality ads. However, and especially for small and medium advertisers, finding the right inventory, at the right price, is non-trivial.

More importantly, being able to accurately evaluate inventory quality has an effect on the location of the utility curve. Programmatic advertising technology providers help advertisers maximize their return on advertising spend (ROAS) while helping publishers maximize their inventory, while monetizing inefficiencies in audience targeting, brand safety, fraud mitigation, regulatory risk and a host of other factors.
Ownyou offers a substantial improvement in visibility and, by offering genuine verifiable data on real people, with accurate representations of their needs and wants, the utility curve shifts outward; making it easier to access higher quality inventory, increasing utility.
