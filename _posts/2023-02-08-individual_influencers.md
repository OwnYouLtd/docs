When it comes to digital identity service, what are individuals most influenced by? Ease of use, reliability, control, clarity and safety. In a word, OwnYou.

In a recent <a href="http://thinksinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CDEI_Digital-Identity_Report_Accessible_3103221.pdf" target="_blank">Britainthinks survey</a>, commissioned by the British government as they shape their digital trust framework, five factors were most influential in the likelihood participants would be willing to use a digital identity service:

Other observations from the Britainthinks survey:

- Individuals want clarity about how identity service providers make money and would prefer them not to be funded by data sharing.
- Individuals want it to be clear what information is shared, and with whom.
- Individuals want digital identity providers to be independent to they want to avoid data being used for other purposes.

OwnYou is not a digital identity service provider. Nevertheless, there are substantial cross overs between using digital identity and personal data to access content and services, which is OwnYouâ€™s endeavour, and using digital identity to prove identity (which is what this survey addresses).

Every one of those observations matches our core objectives; putting the control of data back into the hands of the individual, proving transparency that only a truly decentralised service can provide, using an immutable record of what has been shared and with whom, and making it absolutely clear how that data has been used.
