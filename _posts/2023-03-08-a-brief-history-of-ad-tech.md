Soon after the Internet moved from the academic to the popular domain, banner advertising followed (1994). Media operators initially sold their inventory directly to media buyers and advertisers but, as the number of web pages exploded, so did the amount of display advertising inventory. It soon made sense to serve display ads via dedicated centralised ad servers operated by the likes of DoubleClick.

DoubleClickâ€™s principal product, DART (Dynamic Advertising, Reporting, and Targeting), helped publishers sell their inventory and helped advertisers target their advertising more effectively, improving the return of their ad budgets. After listing in 1998, DoubleClick purchased Abacus Direct in 1999. Abacus Direct specialised in selling consumer-purchasing data to catalogue firms. It became obvious, very early on in this journey, that the more you know about your customer the better you could target them, and the more valuable your services. Privacy advocates complained the acquisition would allow DoubleClick to combine online cookie data with offline identity data. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) found no wrongdoing.

In 2005, the Right Media Exchange was launched as the first global ad exchange. While matching sellers of excess inventory with buyers was a clever enough solution, the real innovation came from allowing advertisers to buy only the ad space that matched their customer targeting requirements. This meant brands could target limited ad budgets to very specific customer demographics.
